********** COMMON COMMANDS **********
(May not be supported on all transceivers.)

FREQ  [VFO frequency Hz]
FREQA [VFO frequency Hz]
FREQB [VFO frequency Hz]
    Get/set the VFO frequency.
    FREQ  - Get/set the currently active VFO frequency, or the VFO-A frequency.
            Behavior depends on the transceiver.
    FREQA - Get/set VFO-A frequency.
    FREQB - Get/set VFO-B frequency.

MODE  [operating mode]
MODEA [operating mode]
MODEB [operating mode]
    Get/set the operating mode.
    See the OperatingMode class for the list of operating modes.
    Not all modes are supported by all transceivers.
    MODE -  Get/set the mode associated with the active VFO, or VFO-A.
            Behavior depends on the transceiver.
    MODEA - Get/set the mode associated with VFO-A.
    MODEB - Get/set the mode associated with VFO-B.

PTT [OFF | ON]
    Get/set the push-to-talk (PTT) status.
    
PTT-METHOD [NONE | CAT | DTR | RTS]
    Get/set the push-to-talk (PTT) method.

SPLIT [OFF | ON]
    Get/set the split operation status.


********** REPEATER COMMANDS **********
(May not be supported on all transceivers.)

RPT-OFFSET <Offset frequency Hz>
    Set the repeater offset frequency in Hz.
    (e.g., -600000 = -6KHz offset)
    Zero sets simplex mode.
    Note that some transceivers may only require this command when setting a
    non-standard offset. Many transceivers have automatic repeater shift (ARS)
    enabled by default.

TONE <OFF | ENC | DEC> [tone frequency in Hz*10]
    Set the repeater tone encoder/decoder mode and frequency.
    OFF = Tone encode/decode off: no tone on transmit or receive
    ENC = Tone encode on: use tone on transmit
    DEC = Tone decode on: use tone on transmit and receive (also known as tone squelch)
    
    CTCSS encode/decode tone frequency is specified in Hz * 10.
    (e.g., 1318 = 131.8 Hz)


********** OTHER COMMANDS **********
(May not be supported on all transceivers.)

DATE [YYYYMMDD]
    Get/set the transceiver date.

LOCK [OFF | ON]
    Get/set the frequency dial lock setting.
    
MONITOR [OFF | ON] [level]
    Get/set the transceiver sidetone/monitor status.
    Turns the sidetone/montor off or on, and sets the monitor level.
    The level should be interpreted as a percentage of full-scale volume (0 - 100).

NB [OFF | ON]
    Get/set the noise blanker state.

NR [OFF | ON]
    Get/set the noise reduction filter state.
    
POWER [level]
    Get/set the RF power level.
    The level should be interpreted as a percentage of full-scale power (0 - 100).

PREAMP [OFF | ON]
    Get/set the preamplifier state.

RIT <OFF | ON>
    Turn receiver incremental tuning (RIT) off/on.
    This is also known as a clarifier (e.g., Yaesu radios).
    
RIT-FREQ <RIT frequency Hz>
    Set the RIT (clarifier) offset frequency in Hz.

SPEECH [OFF | ON] [level]
    Get/set the speech processor level.
    May also be called the speech compressor on some transceivers.
    The level should be interpreted as a percentage of full-scale (0 - 100).

SWAPVFO
    Swap VFO-A <--> VFO-B

TIME [HHMMSS]
    Get/set transceiver time.

VFOMEM [VFO | MEM]
    Get/set the VFO/Memory mode.


********** FT-817 **********

RX-STATUS
    Return the FT-817 Rx status byte.

TX-STATUS
    Return the FT-817 Tx status byte.


********** FT-991 **********

IF-NARROW [OFF | ON]
    Get/set the narrow/wide IF setting.
    See transceiver documentation for details.

IF-SHIFT [shift-val]
    Get/set the IF shift value.
    See transceiver documentation for details.

IF-WIDTH [width-val]
    Get/set the IF width value.
    See transceiver documentation for details.
